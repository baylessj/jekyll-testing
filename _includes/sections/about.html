              Developing mobile apps. Creating games with stunning graphics. Working on
              cutting-edge robotics and artificial intelligence, or even making our own
              operating system. That's the work of ACM.

              The Association for Computing Machinery is the umbrella organization
              for Special Interest Groups (known as SIGs) who specialize in an area
              of computer science, like mobile applications, artificial intelligence,
              game development, high performance computing, multimedia, operating systems,
              security, and more. Each year, the SIGs recruit new members as returning
              ones give guidance and lead team projects. They'll work on a project
              year-round before presenting it to our Corporate Partners.
